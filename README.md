## Introduction
Application for monitoring preferred stocks and some key values for them. Depending on user settings notifications will be dispatched to notify user of changes of selected key values, eg. price crossing, RSI below and so on.

## Features
Still to come..

## Open source
This application is made as an open source hobby project, just because I'm a developer and interested in the stock market and investing. The source code is completely free to check out, use and do whatever you want with according to the MIT license. But I would be extremely happy if you leave a comment, star this project or in any other way show your support.

## At last
Don't involve your feelings in investing and trade wiselyðŸ¤‘
